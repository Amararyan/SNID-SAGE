# TODO List

## Current Issues to Address

### 2. Cluster Detection Error
- **Problem**: When no cluster is found but results are still being returned
- **Status**: Pending  
- **Priority**: High
- **Notes**: 
  - Check spectrum from `data/` directory
  - Investigate why results are returned even when no cluster is detected
  - May need to add validation to prevent false positive results


### 4. Analysis Quality Score Cleanup
- **Problem**: Analysis quality quantitative scores like "RLAP-CCC (analysis quality): 1.74" need to be converted to categories
- **Status**: Pending
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Notes**: 
  - Current quantitative scores (e.g., 1.74) should be converted to categorical values
  - Define clear categories for analysis quality (e.g., "Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Excellent")
  - Update all analysis quality metrics to use categorical instead of numerical values
  - May need to update UI displays and result formatting
  - Consider what threshold values to use for each category
