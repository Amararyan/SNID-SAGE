## AI Assistant (GUI)

Use AI to summarize, interpret, and draft text based on your SNID results.

### Features
- Quick Summary: short explanation of classification
- Detailed Analysis: structured scientific interpretation
- Scientific Context: literature-style discussion
- Publication Text: methods/results text blocks

### Configuration
- Provider: OpenRouter (default)
- Model: choose per analysis (quality vs. cost)
- API Key: Settings → AI → API key

### Workflow
1. Complete SNID analysis
2. Click AI Assistant (deep blue)
3. Choose analysis type and model
4. Review output; copy or export

### Tips for astronomers
- Treat AI output as a draft; verify line IDs and claims
- Include uncertainties and caveats; ask follow-up questions
- Use lower temperature for deterministic summaries

### Cost and privacy
- Requests go to selected provider (e.g., OpenRouter)
- No raw spectra are uploaded; summaries/parameters are sent
- Review provider terms for data retention
