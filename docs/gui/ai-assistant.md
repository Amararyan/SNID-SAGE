### Tips for astronomers
- Treat AI output as a draft; verify line IDs and claims
- Include uncertainties and caveats; ask follow-up questions
- Use lower temperature for deterministic summaries

### Cost and privacy
- Requests go to selected provider (e.g., OpenRouter)
- No raw spectra are uploaded; summaries/parameters are sent
- Review provider terms for data retention
