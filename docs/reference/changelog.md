# Changelog and Release Notes

The canonical changelog is maintained in the repository root. For the most up-to-date release notes:

- View the project changelog in the repository: [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/FiorenSt/SNID-SAGE/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
- Browse tagged releases and notes: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/FiorenSt/SNID-SAGE/releases)

This documentation site intentionally avoids duplicating the changelog to keep a single source of truth.
